Introduction
============
The RetroTax Plugin is configurable, easy-to-use application built for our clients, alliance partners, and partering organizations to screen job seekers, applicants, and new hires for a range of tax credits. The plugin has 3 different modes for use with On-Boarding Systems, Applicant Tracking Systems, and Pre-Qualification Screening.

Demo
============
Website Demo:
[https://www.retrotax-aci.com/plugin-demo/](https://www.retrotax-aci.com/plugin-demo/)

Configuration Demo:
[http://plugin.retrotax-aci.com/](http://plugin.retrotax-aci.com/)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
============
1. Contact tech@retrotax-aci.com to request an API Key. For security, we will white-list your domain so only requests originating from that domain will be accepted.
2. Place `<script type="text/javascript" src="retrotax_plugin.js"></script>` either before the end of your `</head>` tag or at the end before your `</body>` tag (better)
3. Set your configuration values.
4. Whitelist the hostname of where you will install this script (see details below)
5. Verify Code
6. Start Screening

Authorizing Your Hostname
============
The first attempt at using the plugin will result in an invalid hostname, which will kill the iframe after an alert is triggered.  This will continue until you authorize the hostname of where the plugin is installed.  To white-list a hostname, you must configure the plugin and attempt to run the plugin.  For each invalid attempt, an authorization code will be sent to the email address associated to your TCID account.  Please copy and past that code into the configuration settings.  With a valid code, the plugin will whitelist the hostname.  This must be done for all unique hostnames.


Sample Config (Minimum Requirements)
============

```javascript
var _retrotax_options = {
    iframe_base_path: 'widget/iframe',
    username:'demoapi.hiring.manager',
    apikey:'3AED82E2006D43BDGHHGD790BFF937FR',
    plugin_type:'ats'
}
```

Tracking Incomplete ATS and OBS Applications
============
The plugin offers an optional method for tracking users that start the application but do not complete it.  Prior to closing the RetroTax plugin, if a user has not completed the form, the form's data (what has been filled in) is logged as an object, in addition to some other variables we track for error handling.  This feature requires some additional configuration so it's not available client-side in the plugin's settings; however, please reach out to us if this is a requirement for your set-up. Below, a sample incomplete form:
```javascript
(
    [form] => (
            [employeeid] => 0
            [username] => demoapi.hiring.manager
            [locationid] => ? boolean:false ?
            [firstname] => John
            [lastname] => 
            [address] => 3130 2nd St W
            [address2] => 
            [zip] => 
            [city] => 
            [stateid] => 10
            [dob] => 03/02/1987
            [recipient_name] => 
            [recipient_relationship] => 
            [recipient_cityreceived] => 
            [recipient_received_stateid] => 
            [recipient_received_county] => ? undefined:undefined ?
            [agency] => 
            [vocrehabinfo_phone] => 
            [dateconviction] => 
            [daterelease] => 
            [feloninfo_stateid] => ? object:null ?
            [servicestart] => 
            [unemployedstart] => 
            [unemployedstop] => 
            [compensatedstart] => 
            [compensatedstop] => 
        )

    [subject] => Incomplete
    [username] => demoapi.hiring.manager
    [user_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/40.0.2214.111 Chrome/40.0.2214.111 Safari/537.36
    [window_size] => 845 x 993
    [screen_size] => 1865 x 1056
    [location] => http://localhost/plugin/widget/iframe/modal.html
)
```

Callback URL
============
The plugin provides a callback-url in which we will make a POST request with the TCID response after a user has completed and saved an ATS or OBS application.  The callback URL provided must be https; otherwise, the callback url will be ignored.  You can expect to receive a similar JSON structure as this:

```javascript

Styling
============
The configuration settings allow for minor modifications in order to allow styling similar to your existing website/application.  In doing so, we aim to take RetroTax out of the equation for the end-user as much as possible. If you require additional customization, we will gladly accommodate your custom CSS stylesheets, if your provide them. Please contact us if you'd like to discuss this further.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compatability
============
The plugin script that is embeded in your website uses vanilla javascript and not dependent upon any framework (jQuery, etc, etc)

Currently, the plugin supports IE9+ and all modern browsers; however the plugin does not provide support for IE 7,8. If a user is viewing from IE8 the plugin is converted to a direct auto-login link.  So, rather than presented with an IFRAME, the user will be directed to our Tax Credit Screening platform (TCID) within a new browser.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Security
============
* Callback URL must be made over SSL


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mobile
============
Currently, the viewport must be set in the parent window (i.e. yours) in order for the plugin to be responsive on mobile devices.  To do this, ensure the following is set in the `<head>` of your document:

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
